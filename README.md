# Startup-C-projects
I am a rising student of CSE who is trying to learn C language in the 2nd semester. I am trying to create a portfolio of mine with all the projects I will make using C throughout this journey, from the very beginning to the END.
This repo will contain projects made using C from the very basics like "Hello World" to some advance things which I hope to learn in future.
